The Unlocking Game
An engaging unlocking experience built with HTML.

The unlocking game, often referred to as a slider game, challenges players to align sliders to the correct positions or as close as possible. Many variations of this game exist, but this version keeps things simple and fun.

Iâ€™ve kept the styling minimal so you can easily customize it to make it your own. If you do, please give credit!

Controls
Drag your finger or mouse along the sliders.
Toggle dark mode using the switch for a different look.
Rules
Align the green line as close to the target as possible.
If you miss, you lose an attempt.
